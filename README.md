#Complainalyze
#Overview
Complainalyze is a multimodal complaint analysis system that processes and categorizes consumer complaints across various formatsâ€”voice recordings, text, images, and video. Built using an agentic workflow, each module functions as an independent agent, handling specific media types and sending the processed insights to a central aggregator for unified categorization and storage.

This project was developed during [Hackathon Name/Date] by Team [Your Team Name].

#Key Features
Voice Processing: Transcribe and analyze voice complaints using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API or AssemblyAI.
Text Analysis: Categorize text complaints with OpenAI GPT-4.
Image Extraction: Extract and analyze text from images and screenshots using AWS Rekognition or Google Cloud Vision.
Video Analysis: Detect and categorize complaint-related content in videos using Google Cloud Video Intelligence.
Central Aggregation: Integrate and categorize insights from all modules using a Flask-based backend, with data stored in PostgreSQL and indexed by Elasticsearch for efficient retrieval.
Scalable Deployment: Containerized with Docker and managed with Kubernetes for seamless scalability.
