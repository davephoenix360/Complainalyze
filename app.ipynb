After I began the plan, I realized that the XXXX charge was entirely refunded to us on the card ( my XXXX  didn't communicate this with me, and I didn't think to look for a refund on this amount on our card ). I called Chase on XX/XX/year>, to let them know that I had accidentally started the plan and I wanted to cancel it.

Since they told me this, I didn't think to follow-up on it until I noticed that the plan was still active later on. I called Chase back on XX/XX/year>, and explained the situation to them and asked them if they could cancel the plan. Their response was that once the plan is activated, they generally could not cancel it. The representative that I talked to that day said he would try to escalate it and see if their team could do anything about it. I asked him if they would be sending me a confirmation email once it gets processed and he said they don't do that and that if changes are made, that it would reflect on the card.
